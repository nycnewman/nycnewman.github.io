Hi. I'm Edward Newman. I've worked across many industries in technology, particularly focused on security engineering, policies and process. 

My interests have included many areas of technologies but I have specifically worked on:

- "Critical Infrastructure Services". Not power and plumbing but core infrastructure services in large financial services organizations like
   - Active Directory, DNS, DHCP
   - Secure File Transfer
   - Time Services like NTP and PTP
- Enterprise Monitoring - think HP OPenView, BMC but in-house written variants

Over the last few years, I've had the please to work in a small startup and have taken them through SOC2 Type II and ISO27001. This has brought an awareness 
around the challenges with compliance.
